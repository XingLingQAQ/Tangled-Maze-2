## Development

To be able to compile the plugin with the [LootChest](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lootchest.61564/) dependency, you need to install the LootChest jar file in your local maven repository.
You can do this by running the following commands in the directory where the LootChest.jar file is located:
```shell
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<path/to/lootchest.jar> -DgroupId=fr.black_eyes.lootchest -DartifactId=lootchest -Dversion=2.5.0 -Dpackaging=jar
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<path/to/lootchest.jar> -DgroupId=fr.black_eyes.lootchest -DartifactId=fall_effect -Dversion=2.5.0 -Dpackaging=jar
```
